## How Geofence Demo Works

While on the go, sometimes it's easier to automate task for a go-getter such as yourself, There are a lot of things we do every day at a set location. This application helps the commuter automate some of those task in 3 easy steps. 

## Track Yourself

Using Google Maps api, With your permission the app starts by locating where you are on the map. This is useful for people travelling in unknown areas and general visibility!

## Create A Geofence

By Clicking on the map, you are able to place a **Geofence Marker**, this marker, then clicking the settings button in the top right corner you can create a small Geofence circle around the marker you've created. This location will now be tracked! It's that simple.

## Log Geofence Events

Any time you enter or exit your geofence, An event log will fire off that can be sent to a database to track how often you are going and coming from that area! Also a notification will be triggered informing you that the event has just taken place! **Exciting right?* * I think so and I just finished watching the paint dry!(It was amazing!!!)
